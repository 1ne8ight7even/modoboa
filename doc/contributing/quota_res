Notes about quota changes and Reseller user
---------------------------------------------

Reseller user has a quota option in Resources tab. This is the quota that the Reseller can share between all their domains.

There are two quotas for a domain in the new version:

1. Quota & 
2. Default mailbox quota.

[1]. Quota: quota shared between mailboxes
This quota is shared between all the mailboxes of this domain. This value cannot exceed Reseller's quota and hence cannot be 0(unlimited) if Resller has finite quota.

[2]. Default mailbox quota: default quota applied to mailboxes
This quota is the default quota applied to new mailboxes. This value cannot exceed Quota[1] and hence cannot be 0(unlimited) if Quota[1] is finite.
