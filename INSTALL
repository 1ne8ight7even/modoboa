How to install
--------------

Download Mailng's tarball and extract it::
  tar xzf mailng-<version>.tar.gz

Enter the mailng repository, create a settings.py file (you can use settings-sample.py as a model). Specify database relative informations. You must choose between mysql and postgresql, other types are not supported by major email projects like postfix or dovecot.

Initialise the database by running the following command::
  python manage.py syncdb

Create the super admin account (just follow the procedure).

Testing installation
--------------------

As a typical Django application, Mailng can be tested using a simple web server. Just run this command to start it::
  python manage.py runserver
