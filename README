Mailng is a light web messaging solution. It provides different tools that facilitates virtual domains hosting. It is designed to be integrated with email servers like postfix (http://www.postfix.org/) and/or dovecot (http://www.dovecot.org/).

For now, only the administration component is available. Additional tools will come in a near future.

Django is needed to use Mailng (http://www.djangoproject.com/)

Mootools version 1.2 (http://www.mootools.net/) and SqueezeBox version 1.1 (http://digitarald.de/project/squeezebox/) are provided with Mailng.
